// v0.16.0 — Six things the device found that no compiler could. The big one:
//           NOTHING on the sheet was actually draggable, because a handle that
//           claims the gesture on MOVE loses to a ScrollView that has already
//           started panning — so grabbing a caliper scrolled the paper under
//           it. Every handle now claims on touch-down and freezes both scrolls
//           while held. Plus: the trace gets the screen back (icon toolbar,
//           one-line headline, words moved into a ⋯ sheet), a LANDSCAPE full
//           screen fitted to all six leads, the caliper readout out of the
//           trace's way, reference lines grabbable along their length, and R
//           peaks on every lead instead of only II.

// v0.15.0 — The History tab becomes the module it is on the web. Captures file
//           themselves into an on-device store the moment an exam ends; the tab
//           lists them from a cached summary; opening one gives a tiled vector
//           sheet at the frozen 25 mm/s · 10 mm/mV with the whole web toolbox
//           re-thought for a finger: draggable calipers, tap-to-mark, reference
//           lines, a ghost trace with three alignments, filter stages, and
//           export by share sheet (CSV, EDF+, a built PDF). Every tool is behind
//           the same RBAC permission the web checks, and every read, write,
//           export and delete is audit-logged.

// v0.14.0 — The floating CYPHIX wordmark in the top-start corner is behind
//           `SHOW_SHELL_WORDMARK` and currently off, at the user's request.
//           Hidden, not deleted — and the 70pt of padding that existed only
//           to clear it follows the same switch, so nothing reserves space
//           for something that is not drawn.

// v0.13.0 — The app gets an i18n layer mirroring the web's: a language
//           registry, en/he locale tables typed against each other, a provider
//           backed by the pre-hydrated preferences slice (so the first paint is
//           already in the right language), and a Language picker at the top of
//           Settings → Appearance. Every user-facing string now comes from the
//           locale; adding a third language is one new file plus three lines.
